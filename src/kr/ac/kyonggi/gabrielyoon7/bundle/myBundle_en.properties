description=While managing the department's <a rel="nofollow" href="http://cs.kyonggi.ac.kr:8080" target="_blank">website</a>, I greatly improved the structure that I thought was a problem and redesigned it from the beginning. In order to solve the fundamental problem I felt while maintaining the project, I redesigned all the codes related to the structure from the beginning. However, only functions directly related to structural improvement in the size of the project were implemented and unrelated functions were omitted.
